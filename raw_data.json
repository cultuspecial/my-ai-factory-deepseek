    "title": "Evolutionary Strategies lead to Catastrophic Forgetting in LLMs",
    "summary": "One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However,",

    "title": "SokoBench: Evaluating Long-Horizon Planning and Reasoning in Large Language Models",
    "summary": "Although the capabilities of large language models have been increasingly tested on complex reasoning tasks, their long-horizon planning abilities have not yet been extensively investigated. In this work, we provide a systematic assessment of the planning and long-horizon reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We propose a novel benchmark based on Sokoban puzzles, intentionally simplified to isolate long-horizon planning from state persistence. Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in planning performance when more than 25 moves are required to reach the solution, suggesting a fundamental constraint on forward planning capacity. We show that equipping LRMs with Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) parsing, validation, and solving tools allows",

    "title": "Exploring Transformer Placement in Variational Autoencoders for Tabular Data Generation",
    "summary": "Tabular data remains a challenging domain for generative models. In particular, the standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, typically composed of multilayer perceptrons, struggles to model relationships between features, especially when handling mixed data types. In contrast, Transformers, through their attention mechanism, are better suited for capturing complex feature interactions. In this paper, we empirically investigate the impact of integrating Transformers into different components of a VAE. We conduct experiments on 57 datasets from the OpenML CC18 suite and draw two main conclusions. First, results indicate that positioning Transformers to leverage latent and decoder representations leads to a trade-off between fidelity and diversity. Second, we observe a high simila",

    "title": "Post-Training Fairness Control: A Single-Train Framework for Dynamic Fairness in Recommendation",
    "summary": "Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address this limitation, we propose Cofair, a single-train framework that enables post-training fairness control in recommendation. Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across",

    "title": "A New Dataset and Framework for Robust Road Surface Classification via Camera-IMU Fusion",
    "summary": "Road surface classification (RSC) is a key enabler for environment-aware predictive maintenance systems. However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-st",

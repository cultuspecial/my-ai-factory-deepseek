    "title": "Biases in the Blind Spot: Detecting What LLMs Fail to Mention",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statist",

    "title": "Olaf-World: Orienting Latent Actions for Video World Modeling",
    "summary": "Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-",

    "title": "Step-resolved data attribution for looped transformers",
    "summary": "We study how individual training examples shape the internal computation of looped transformers, where a shared block is applied for $τ$ recurrent iterations to enable latent reasoning. Existing training-data influence estimators such as TracIn yield a single scalar score that aggregates over all loop iterations, obscuring when during the recurrent computation a training example matters. We introduce \\textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$τ$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reas",

    "title": "Causality in Video Diffusers is Separable from Denoising",
    "summary": "Causality -- referring to temporal, uni-directional cause-effect relationships between components -- underlies many complex generative processes, including videos, language, and robot trajectories. Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and prim",

    "title": "Agent World Model: Infinity Synthetic Environments for Agentic Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compare",
